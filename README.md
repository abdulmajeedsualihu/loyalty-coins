# Kawoho - Decentralized Event Check-in and Rewards DApp

## 🚀 Introduction
Kawoho is a decentralized application (DApp) that revolutionizes event check-ins by rewarding attendees who arrive on time. Built with blockchain technology, it ensures a secure, transparent, and automated system for event participation.

## 🎯 Features
- **Decentralized Event Check-in**: Attendees scan a QR code to register their presence.
- **Token Rewards**: Participants receive tokens for timely check-ins.
- **Organizer Verification**: Event hosts can verify attendees before distributing rewards.
- **Secure and Transparent**: Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity.
- **Automated Winner Selection**: The first three attendees to check in receive additional incentives.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain Integration:** viem, ethers.js
- **Smart Contract:** Solidity
- **QR Code Scanning:** html5-qrcode

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Event Creation**: Organizers create events and generate unique QR codes.
2. **Attendee Registration**: Users sign up and receive a QR code linked to their wallet.
3. **Check-in Process**: Participants scan their QR code upon arrival.
4. **Blockchain Verification**: The smart contract validates attendance.
5. **Token Distribution**: Attendees receive rewards based on check-in timing.
